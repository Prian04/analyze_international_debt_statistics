# Analyze International Debt Statistics
This project involves analyzing international debt statistics using SQL, leveraging a dataset provided by the **World Bank https://www.worldbank.org/** . The dataset contains valuable insights into global debt trends, offering a rich resource for data analysis for use case.

## Use Case
The analysis explores the debt data to uncover patterns, perform aggregations, and provide insights into international debt at various levels.

## Files
* **international_debt.sql:** Contains all SQL queries used for the analysis, including data exploration

* **image files:** Each query is accompanied by a snapshot of its output, saved as an image. The images are named according to the question they address. For example: no_of_distinct_country.jpg

* **international_debt.csv:**  This is the original dataset provided by the World Bank. The dataset contains detailed information on international debt statistics. The dataset has been imported into SQL for analysis.

## Technologies Used
* **Mysql**
* **Excel**

## Key Learnings and Insights
* Enhanced proficiency in SQL by working with real-world data, creating efficient queries, and debugging issues related to large datasets.
* Through the queries, we uncovered insightful patterns in international debt statistics, including country-specific and indicator-code debt distributions.
* This project provided an excellent opportunity to work hands-on with SQL, performing various types of queries such as data exploration, filtering, aggregation, and joins.
* The process of importing the dataset (international_debt.csv) into SQL and understanding the table schema helped in structuring effective queries.

## Conclusion
This project offered a comprehensive experience in analyzing real-world data using SQL. By leveraging a globally recognized dataset from the World Bank, we gained valuable insights into international debt trends while sharpening SQL skills. The queries saved in international_debt.sql serve as a reusable resource for similar data analysis projects.
